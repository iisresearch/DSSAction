1;1;mandatory;Hi! I'd like to talk to you about part 2 of your BI assignment. The idea is that I help you to reflect about your solution - please note that I cannot tell you whether it is "correct". Let's start! Is there any particular aspect that you would like to discuss? If not, I will walk you through a number of questions that I have prepared for you...;;;;any;;any;
1;2;mandatory;Can you please define the grain of your model?;OK, but can you say what constitutes a single fact?;If you want you can read about the grain concept on page 6 of the multidimensional modeling primer. Shall we continue the discussion?;grain;all;fact,row;any;Fine. Can you say what your measures and dimensions are?
1;3;optional;Why have you chosen the dimensions in your model?;Can you pick any of your dimensions and justify why it's needed?;;dimension;all;question;any;
1;4;optional;How do you know that your chosen dimensions are true to the grain?;Can you say in what kind of relation a dimension should be with a fact?;Again, you might want to go back to the multidimensional modeling primer and read from page 6 onwards. Shall we continue the discussion?;grain,dimension;all;single;any;
1;5;optional;How do you know that your chosen fact meaasures are true to the grain?;Can you say in what kind of relation a measure should be with a fact?;Again, you might want to go back to the multidimensional modeling primer and read from page 6 onwards. Shall we continue the discussion?;grain,measure;all;single;any;
1;6;optional;What about your dimension hierarchies: how do you know that they are sound?;Can you say which kind of relation should hold between a hierarchy level and the next higher one?;Again, you might want to go back to the multidimensional modeling primer and read page 7. Shall we continue the discussion?;dimension,hiearchy;any;oneN,drill-down;any;
1;7;optional;When you look at your measures, how can you be sure that they are really measures (and not maybe dimensions...)?;Hmm, I'm not sure I understand. Can you say what values you expect the measures to take on?;Well, and what do you want to do with the values of the measures?;measure;all;aggregate,numeric;any;
1;8;mandatory;What did you do to make your multidimensional model visible in Tableau?;What does the left side of your worksheets look like? Did you modify that somehow?;;dimension,measure;all;hierarchy,arrange;any;Ok. Please pick one of the diagrams where you are slightly unsure. Why do you think that you have chosen the right representation/chart type?
